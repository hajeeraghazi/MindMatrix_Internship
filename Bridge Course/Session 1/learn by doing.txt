In this session, I explored the Android ecosystem and understood how Android devices, applications, and system components work together. I learned about the structure of Android applications, including Activities, layouts, resources, and the project hierarchy in Android Studio.

I also became familiar with the Android Studio interface, created a new project, and understood how UI and Kotlin code connect. The session highlighted the importance of accessibility and user-centered design to make applications inclusive and easy to use.

Finally, I conceptualized my first app idea — a student productivity app that helps users manage tasks, set reminders, and track study progress. This session helped me build a strong foundation for future Android development projects.
