The objective of this task was to create and document a Jetpack Compose project while exploring layout primitives, modifiers, UI structure, and design refinement.

Project Description

In this project, I developed a Student Dashboard UI using Jetpack Compose. The application demonstrates structured UI layout using fundamental Compose components such as:

Column

Row

Box

Text

Spacer

Modifier

Layout Structure
🔹 Column

Used as the main vertical layout container to structure the dashboard elements.

🔹 Row

Used inside the Task Summary section to arrange task statistics horizontally.

🔹 Box

Used to create a card-like profile section with background color and rounded corners.

Modifier Usage

The following modifiers were applied:

fillMaxSize() → Makes layout occupy full screen

fillMaxWidth() → Expands component horizontally

padding() → Adds spacing around elements

background() → Adds background color

RoundedCornerShape() → Adds rounded corners

Arrangement.SpaceBetween → Distributes elements evenly

Alignment.CenterVertically → Aligns content vertically

Responsive Design Testing

The UI was tested using @Preview to ensure:

Proper spacing

Alignment consistency

Clean hierarchy

Readability

Design Refinement

Improvements made during refinement:

Added spacing using Spacer

Applied background colors for visual grouping

Used rounded corners for modern UI styling

Maintained consistent padding for better accessibility

Learning Outcomes

Through this task, I strengthened my understanding of:

Composable functions

Layout hierarchy

State-free UI structure

Modifier chaining

UI responsiveness

Design consistency principles

This task improved my ability to structure, analyze, and refine Compose-based UI layouts effectively.
